### Welcome

Hi, I'm Jesse!

I write open source software with a focus on abstract capabilities often overlooked.

- [Package repositories](https://github.com/JesseCoretta?tab=repositories)
- [Code Coverages](https://app.codecov.io/gh/JesseCoretta?repoDisplay=Active)
- [News](https://github.com/JesseCoretta/JesseCoretta/blob/main/NEWS.md)

More package repositories are **always** in development -- stay tuned!

Got a question or an idea? Need help? I do contract work! You can reach me [here](mailto:jesse.coretta@icloud.com).
