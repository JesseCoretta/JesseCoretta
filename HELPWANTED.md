![HelpWanted](https://img.shields.io/badge/Help%20Wanted-red)

Repositories bearing this badge indicate that I am actively looking for open source contributors with a particular skill set, typically due to the nature and/or goals of a particular package.

Remember, in this lousy job market, open source contributions can serve to fill gaps in your employment histories. Just because you don't get paid for it does not mean the effort should be discounted.
