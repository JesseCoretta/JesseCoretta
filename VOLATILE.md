About the [![Volatility Warning](https://img.shields.io/badge/volatile-darkred?label=%F0%9F%92%A5&labelColor=white&color=orange&cacheSeconds=86400)](https://github.com/JesseCoretta/JesseCoretta/blob/main/VOLATILE.md) Badge

The volatile badge indicates a particular software package I have released is VERY new.

A volatile repository or package should never be considered stable. Proceed at your own peril.
