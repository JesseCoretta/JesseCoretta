### Donation Information

If you find my open source software useful and would like to make a donation, I would ask that you instead donate to one of the following animal charities:

  - The Humane Society
  - World Wildlife Fund
  - ASPCA

If you reside in the general vicinity of San Diego CA, please consider making your donation to the [Cat AdopTion Service (CATS) of San Diego](https://www.globalgiving.org/projects/homes-for-paws-cat-adoption-service-rescue/).

You may also choose to donate to a reputable animal shelter or clinic in your area.

If you cannot afford a monetary contribution, consider volunteering at a local shelter, or help coordinate the liberation of animals confined at kill shelters unfairly awaiting execution.

Thank you! - Jesse Coretta
