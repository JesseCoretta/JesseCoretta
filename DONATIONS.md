### Donation Information

If you find my open source software useful and would like to make a donation, I would ask that you instead donate to one of the following animal charities:

  - [Cat AdopTion Service (CATS) of San Diego](https://www.globalgiving.org/projects/homes-for-paws-cat-adoption-service-rescue/)
  - [Animal Legal Defense Fund](https://give.aldf.org)
  - [The Humane Society](https://www.humanesociety.org/resources/donations-faq)
  - World Wildlife Fund
  - ASPCA

You may also choose to donate to a reputable animal shelter or clinic in your area. If you cannot afford a monetary contribution, consider **volunteering** at a local shelter, or help coordinate the liberation of animals confined at kill shelters unfairly awaiting execution.

Thank you! - Jesse Coretta
