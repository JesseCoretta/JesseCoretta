About the [![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/experimental-blue?logoColor=blue&label=%F0%9F%A7%AA%20%F0%9F%94%AC&labelColor=blue&color=gray)](https://github.com/JesseCoretta/JesseCoretta/blob/main/EXPERIMENTAL.md) Badge

The experimental badge indicates a particular software package I have released is relatively infantile (new) and has not been reviewed and field tested by the masses.

The state of being experimental is not influenced in any way by code quality nor test coverage. It should only be retracted (or reinforced) based upon community reception and sentiment for the package.

An experimental package can still be considered stable, so long as test coverage factors are suitably high.
